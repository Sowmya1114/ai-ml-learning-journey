# ai-ml-learning-journey
This repository documents my journey of learning Artificial Intelligence 
and Machine Learning from scratch.

# Day-01 Python basics
Topics covered:
- Introduction to Python
- print() function
- Variables
- Input and output
- Basic arithmetic operations

Practice includes simple Python programs written and tested by me.

# Day-02 Data types and Conditional statements

## topics covered
- Python data types: int, float, string, boolean
- type() function
- Type conversion (int, float)
- Conditional statements: if, elif, else
- Comparison operators
- Even or odd number
- Positive or negative number
- Find biggest of two numbers
## Learning outcome
Gained clarity on how Python handles different types of data and how
to control program flow using conditional statements.

# Day-03 Loops in Python

## Topics Covered
- for loop
- while loop
- range() function
- Loop control with conditions

## Practice Programs
- Printing numbers using loops
- Even numbers using loop and condition
- Sum of first N numbers
- Multiplication table
- Factorial of a number

## Learning Outcome
Understood how to repeat tasks using loops and apply logic inside loops
for solving basic programming problems.

                                                                                                                                                                          
# Day 04 List,Tuple,Set

## Topics covers
-List: create, access, add, remove, slicing
-Tuple: immutable sequences, access elements
-Set: unique, unordered, add/remove, membership check

## Practice Programs
- Basic operations with lists, tuples, sets
- Sum of numbers in a list
- Access tuple elements
- Set operations: add/remove/check

## Learning Outcome
Understood Python collection types and how to manipulate and access data,
which is essential for handling data in ML/AI projects.

# Day 05 – Dictionaries & Functions

## Topics Covered
- Python dictionaries (key-value pairs)
- Adding, updating and looping dictionaries
- Functions using def
- Function parameters and return values

## Practice Programs
- Student details using dictionary
- Marks calculation
- Even/Odd check using function
- Maximum of two numbers using function

## Learning Outcome
Learned how to store structured data using dictionaries and how to
reuse logic using functions, which are essential for ML and AI projects.
