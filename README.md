This repository documents my journey of learning Artificial Intelligence 
and Machine Learning from scratch.

## Day 01 – Python Basics
Topics covered:
- Introduction to Python
- print() function
- Variables
- Input and output
- Basic arithmetic operations

Practice includes simple Python programs written and tested by me.

# Day 02 – Data Types & Conditional Statements

- Python data types: int, float, string, boolean
- type() function
- Type conversion (int, float)
- Conditional statements: if, elif, else
- Comparison operators
- Even or odd number
- Positive or negative number
- Find biggest of two numbers
## Learning Outcome
Gained clarity on how Python handles different types of data and how
to control program flow using conditional statements.

# Day 03 – Loops in Python

## Topics Covered
- for loop
- while loop
- range() function
- Loop control with conditions

## Practice Programs
- Printing numbers using loops
- Even numbers using loop and condition
- Sum of first N numbers
- Multiplication table
- Factorial of a number

## Learning Outcome
Understood how to repeat tasks using loops and apply logic inside loops
for solving basic programming problems.
